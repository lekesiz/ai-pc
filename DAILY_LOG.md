## January 6, 2025

### 🎉 Project Kickoff - Day 1

**Completed Today:**
- ✅ Full backend infrastructure setup
  - FastAPI with async support
  - PostgreSQL + Alembic migrations
  - JWT authentication system

**Technical Decisions:**
- Chose FastAPI over Next.js API routes for better Python AI library support
- Implemented Zustand for state management (simpler than Redux)
- Used Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- Structured project as monorepo for easier development

**Commits Made:**
1. Initial documentation and project structure
2. Backend infrastructure with AI router
3. Frontend with TypeScript and chat UI
4. Voice recording and transcription
5. Documentation and roadmap

**Metrics:**
- Total files: ~50+
- Lines of code: ~4500+
- Test coverage: 0% (TODO)
- Features completed: 8/8 Phase 1 goals

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- Start Phase 2 features
- Priority: File upload/attachment support
- Set up S3 or local file storage
- Implement drag-and-drop UI

**Notes:**
- OpenAI API key required for testing
- Consider implementing mock mode for development
- Need to add rate limiting before production
